24-hour Hackathon project for Lumohacks 2017.


# Goal: 
Help patients with phobias overcome their fears with exposure therepy. 

# Description: 
Create different levels to allow user to establish goals, sound effects, opt out by turning the scenario into sth entertaining, measure heartbeat with fitbit to opt out when user’s heartbeat is too fast 

# Tools: 
Google cardboard, unity, web API, Combine internet of things (IOT) with VR 

# Audience: 

The goal of this project is to help patients overcome their phobia with exposure therapy. Exposure therapy involves the exposure of the patient to their feared object without any danger to overcome their distress overttime. The target audience is 12-18 years old, as most phobias develop at the age of 11. Parents, doctors or professional can guide the process using the app. The project is built with Unity, C++, Google VR SDK, and Google Cardboard.

# Three different modes- 
Fear for: Spider, snake, heights; 
Main menu to choose the modes and levels 

# Future Expansion 
We can work with psychiatrists, pediatrician, and researchers on the topic of phobia therapy amongst children. We can easily pair the project with additional hardwares such as Muse and Fitbit to keep track of the changes in patients' physical response (i.e brain waves, blood pressure, heart rate). Doctors would be able to view real-time statstical data on their website to identify any improvements. The amount of time patient stays in the scenario and their qualititative feedback can also be noted. 

The fundings of the project can be divided into two parts: 1) governmental 2) commercial. 

This research project, to investigate the impact of Virtual Reality on combatting phobias, can apply for funds by agencies such as Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR). The comprehensive list of funding sources can be found: http://www.cpa.ca/researchers/researchfunding/funders. We can also gather funds commercially. For example, we can collaborate with snake or spider repellent companies to demonstrate their products at the end of the scenes or put ads on the windows of skyscrapers.
